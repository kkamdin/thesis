\section{Liquid Xenon as a Detector Medium}
Liquid xenon detectors are powerful tools for rare event searches. In particular, the dual phase \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC} has been very successful in accessing \ac{WIMP} parameter space and currently holds the worlds most sensitive limits on \ac{WIMP}s. This section describes the properties of \ac{LXe} and the basic principles of \ac{TPC}s that have allowed this technology to play a large role in the hunt for dark matter.

\subsection{Properties of Liquid Xenon}
Liquid xenon has many properties relevant to particle detection, particle identification, and also many properties related to the ease of detector operation:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The density of \ac{LXe} is 2.9~g/cm$^{3}$ at 170~K, much denser than other possible \ac{TPC} target materials, such as liquid argon which has density 1.4~g/cm$^{3}$ at 87~K. The advantage in this two-fold: (1) the same volume contains more kg of Xe than Ar, so for two detectors of the same volume, one filled with Xe and the other with Ar, both running for one year, the Xe detector has more exposure; (2) xenon's high density effectively stops external radiation, producing an ultra-low-background volume in the center of the detector where rare-event searches can be performed (this region is called the ``fiducial volume'').
  
  \item Xenon gas is easily liquefied with liquid nitrogen (77~K) or commercially available pulse tube refrigerators.

  \item Xenon has no long-lived radioisotopes that cause troublesome backgrounds. The one exception is the 2$\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe (natural abundance 8.875\%) with measured half-life of $2.1 \times 10^{21}$ years. The long half-life and relatively low abundance together result in a very low count rate, and the isotope can be used to search for neutrino-less double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$).
  
  \item Xenon, as a noble element, is easily purified with a heated getter to rid electronegative impurities (e.g. O$_{2}$) that interfere with the ionization signal. 
  
  \item The comparatively large mass of xenon allows it to be purified of other noble gasses via gas chromatography \cite{LUXKrRemoval2018} and cryogenic distillation \cite{Xe1TKrRemoval2017}. As other noble gasses cannot be removed via getter, this feature is extremely useful in removing the troublesome background of $^{85}$Kr decay. $^{85}$Kr decays via beta emission to stable $^{85}$Rb with a half-life of 10.8 years and Q$_{\beta}$ = 687~keV. The decay proceeds directly to the $^{85}$Rb ground state with a branching ratio of 99.6\%. Since no de-excitation of $^{85}$Rb follows, this beta decay cannot be rejected as background by coincidence with a gamma, and relies purely on the ability to discriminate between WIMP-like \ac{NR} and beta- or gamma- produced \ac{ER}. While ER/NR discrimination is one of the features of \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s (described in section \ref{sec:er_nr_discrimination}), leakage of \ac{ER} events in to the \ac{NR} signal region can occur and the best mitigation is to remove as much of the  $^{85}$Kr as possible. Single-phase \ac{LXe} detectors, with no ER/NR discrimination, benefit greatly from the ability to remove $^{85}$Kr.
  
  \item Particles interacting in \ac{LXe} excite atoms and create electron ion-pairs, producing detectable quanta: scintillation photons and ionization electrons, respectively (described in section \ref{sec:signal_generation}).
  
  \item Xenon produces scintillation light of wavelength $\lambda$~=~178~nm (described in section \ref{sec:signal_generation}). Xenon is transparent to this wavelength so it can propagate freely and be directly detected with current \ac{PMT} technology, and doesn't require the use of e.g wavelength shifter. 
  
  \item Ionization electrons produced in particle interactions can be drifted and extracted into a gaseous region via applied electric fields, where they undergo proportional scintillation. By this method, a single electron is amplified many-fold into detectable photons. This basic operating principle of dual-phase \ac{TPC}s makes even a single ionization electron detectable. 
  
  \item Xenon has high light and charge yields, and therefore a low threshold for producing detectable quanta. A useful quantity is the so-called `W-value' of \ac{LXe}: W = 13.7 $\pm$ 0.2 eV \cite{Dahl2009}. The W-value, analogous to a work-function, is a measure of the average energy expenditure to produce one quanta (scintillation photon or an ionization electron) from liquid xenon. 
  
  \item \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s are easily scalable: creating a large homogenous volume is straightforward. In contrast, solid state detectors, such as cryogenic Ge, are more difficult to scale up directly and require instead the production of multiple small modules (O(10)~cm) which each must be instrumented separately.  
    
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Scintillation and Ionization Signal Generation}
\label{sec:signal_generation}
A particle can interact with a xenon atom through interaction with an orbiting electron, creating an \ac{ER}, or though an interaction with the xenon nucleus, where the nucleus is imparted with momentum and recoils, \ac{NR}. Some energy is lost to atomic motion (heat). The recoiling electron or nucleus loses energy via interaction with neighboring xenon atoms, creating more excited atoms and electron-ion pairs. The excited xenon atoms, Xe$^{*}$, combine with other atoms to form an excited dimer, or excitons, Xe$_{2}^{*}$. The excited dimer forms two states: a triplet and a singlet, which de-excite with the emission of a 178~nm photon. The lifetimes of the triplet and singlet are measured to be 24~ns and 3~ns, respectively \cite{Mock2014}. Since the scintillation light is produced by the excimer, which has a different electronic structure than atomic xenon, the light is free to propagate through the detector and will not be absorbed by the atomic xenon. The Xe$^{+}$ ions of the electron-ion pairs combine with other Xe atoms to form dimers Xe$_{2}^{+}$, and these dimers can combine with electrons (from the electron-ion pairs) to form excitons, Xe$_{2}^{*}$, which then decay and produce additional 178~nm scintillation photons. This process is called recombination. If no electric field is applied, all electron-ion pairs recombine to produce additional scintillation photons. If an external electric field is present, some electrons can be drifted away from the interaction site to be detected with other methods. 

The sensitivity of liquid xenon detectors to low energy recoils depends on their ability to detect the 178~nm scintillation photons with high-efficiency. High \ac{QE} \ac{PMT}s constructed with ultra-low radioactivity materials are the go-to instrument for this purpose. In addition to high-efficiency photon-detectors, liquid xenon detectors must also have high geometrical light collection efficiency to optimize sensitivity. Single-phase liquid xenon detectors, where no electric field is applied, maximize light-collection by with a spherical geometry, endeavoring to cover 4$\pi$ steradians surrounding the \ac{LXe}. The XMASS detector uses spherical geometry to accomplish photocathode coverage of \~62\%, and two types of Hamamatsu \ac{PMT}s (R10789-11 and R10789-11MOD) with \ac{QE} of 28\%, and quote a signal collection efficiency of 20\% \cite{Abe2013}, \cite{XMASSCollaboration2018}. Dual-phase \ac{TPC} detectors are lined with \ac{PTFE} to take advantage of its extremely high (~99\%) reflectivity for 178~nm light in \ac{LXe} \cite{Neves2017}. The \ac{LUX} detector uses a cylindrical geometry, with all non-light-collectiing surfaces lined with \ac{PTFE}, and Hamamatsu R8778 \ac{PMT}s (\ac{QE} of 33\%) only on the top and bottom of the detector (low photocathode coverage), to accomplish a light collection efficiency of 90\% \cite{Faham2014}.

If the detector is a \ac{TPC} the ionization electrons are drifted away from the interaction site to be detected. Single phase \ac{TPC} employ thin wires to collect the ionization electrons. For example, the EXO-200 experiment is a single-phase liquid xenon \ac{TPC} that uses crossed-wire planes to collect the ionization electrons and avalanche photodiodes to collect the scintillation photons \cite{Auger2012}. \ac{LUX} is a dual-phase xenon \ac{TPC}, where ionization electrons produced in the large liquid region are drifted and extracted into gaseous xenon via applied electric fields, where they undergo proportional scintillation. The proportional scintillation light is the same 178~nm wavelength as scintillation in the liquid produced in the liquid, and it is similarly collected via high \ac{QE} \ac{PMT}s.

In addition to light-collection efficiency, the sensitivity of \ac{TPC} xenon detectors also depends on their ability to collect signal from the ionization electrons. There are challenges in delivering \ac{HV} to liquid xenon in order to set up the electric field which drifts the ionization electrons (some of these challenges are explained in Chapter \ref{ch:testbed}). Additionally, electronegative impurities such as oxygen (O$_{2}$) present in the detector attract and capture ionization electrons as they drift, eating away the ionization signal. These non-noble impurities are removed by constantly circulating the xenon through a heated zirconium getter and returning it to the detection volume. Purification through a getter must be done in gaseous phase, so liquid xenon removed from the detection volume is evaporated, passed through the getter via a circulation system, and re-condensed into the detection volume. 


\section{Dual-Phase Xenon Time Projection Chamber}
A particle interacting in a noble liquid or gas target deposits energy into scintillation and ionization channels (Section \ref{sec:signal_generation}). The basic operating principle of \ac{TPC}s is to drift the ionization electrons away from the interaction site and detect them at a later time than the scintillation signal is detected. A dual phase liquid xenon \ac{TPC} is a type of \ac{TPC} with a large liquid target volume and a small region of xenon vapor above the liquid volume, instrumented with light sensors (typically \ac{PMT}s). A particle interacting in the liquid target produces both scintillation photons and ionization electrons at the interaction site. The scintillation photons are promptly detected by the \ac{PMT}s, this primary signal is called S1. The ionization electrons are drifted upward to the gas region by an applied electric field, and extracted across the liquid-gas boundary by a higher electric field, where they undergo proportional scintillation and produce a second signal detected by the \ac{PMT}s, called S2. The field is supplied by a series of electrodes, composed of wire planes, grids, or chemically etched meshes, held at constant voltages. The bottom-most field-producing electrode is called the cathode, at the top of the liquid region is the gate or extraction electrode, followed O(1)~cm by the anode. The liquid region is often referred to as the `drift region' and region between the gate and anode is referred to as the `extraction region'. The drift region takes up by far more volume than the extraction region. The electrons are extracted from liquid to gas with some efficiency, called the \ac{EEE}. This efficiency plays an important role in the operation of dual-phase \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s, and is discussed further in  \textbf{E-Train CHAPTER}.

The S2 in a dual-phase \ac{TPC} plays two important roles: (i) internal amplification of the signal, whereby a few electrons are transformed into O(10) times as many photons (ii) $(x,y)$ localization via \ac{PMT} hit pattern. The time spacing of the S1 and S2 signals can be converted to depth ($z$) of the interaction, providing full $(x,y,z)$-reconstruction of the interaction position.

\subsection{Energy Reconstruction}
Energy reconstruction in dual-phase xenon \ac{TPC}s comes from the measurable quantities, S1 and S2, but begins with the number of excitons $n_{ex}$  and electron-ions pairs $n_{i}$ generated at the interaction site. 
\begin{equation}
E = f W (n_{ex} + n_{i} )
\end{equation}

where $E$ is the deposited energy. $W$ is the average energy needed to produce a single excited or ionized atom, $W = 13.7 \pm 0.2$~eV \cite{Mock2014}. The quenching factor, $f$ is 1 for electronic recoils but $f \neq 1$ for nuclear recoils. For now, take the case of electronic recoils and set $f=1$. This equation can be rewritten:

\begin{equation}
E_{ER} = W (1 + \frac{n_{ex}}{n_{i}} ) n_{i}
\end{equation}

The ratio of excitons to ions is constant for electron recoils $n_{ex}/{n_{i}} = 0.2$ \cite{LUX:YieldsAndRecombination}. As discussed in Section \label{sec:signal_generation}, each exciton deexcites, emitting a 178~nm photon, some fraction $r$ of the initial electron-ion pairs recombine and form additional excitons. The total number of prompt scintillation photons created by the interaction is then:

\begin{equation}
n_{\gamma} = (r + \frac{n_{ex}}{n_{i}} ) n_{i}
\end{equation}

And the total number of electrons created by interaction site (electrons escaping recombination) is:

\begin{equation}
n_{e} = (1 - r ) n_{i}
\end{equation}

Thus, the effect of recombination is to ``trade-out'' electrons for photons, but the total number of quanta is conserved (Figure~\ref{fig:recombination} (left)). The amount of recombination depends on applied electric field, \ac{LXe} density, and particle energy \cite{LUX:YieldsAndRecombination}. In the case of the 122~keV electron recoils in Figure~\ref{fig:recombination} (right): at low fields, most of the electron-ion pairs recombine, which results in more scintillation photons. As the applied electric field increases, more electrons are pulled away from the interaction site resulting in fewer scintillation photons and more ionization electrons. These amounts of photons and electrons are referred to as the scintillation and ionization yields. The two quantities, $n_{\gamma}$  and $n_{e}$ relate directly to the observable S1 and S2 signals:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:energy}
\begin{split}
E_{ER} &= W (n_{\gamma} + n_{e} ) \\
   &= W (\frac{S1}{g_{1}} + \frac{S2}{g_{2}})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $E_{ER}$ reminds us that we are taking the case of electronic recoils and set $f=1$ in Equation~\ref{eq:energy}. S1 and S2 are in units of detected photons (phd), and $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ are detector gains in units of phd / quanta. $g_{1}$ is the detection efficiency for the prompt scintillation photons: it is a product of the the average a geometrical light collection efficiency and the average \ac{PMT} \ac{QE}. Typical values for $g_{1}$ are in the range of 0.01-0.02. $g_{2}$ is the analogous quantity for S2 proportional scintillation light: it is a product of the \ac{EEE} and the average number of detected photons produced by one extracted electron. Typical values for $g_{2}$ are in the range 10-60.

(right) Field dependence of scintillation and ionization yield in LXe for 122 keV electron recoils (ER), 56.5 keVr nuclear recoils (NR) and 5.5 MeV alphas, relative to the yield with no drift field from \cite{Aprile2010}}
\label{fig:recombination}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To properly reconstruct the energy of nuclear recoils, we must revisit the quenching factor factor $f$. Equation~\ref{eq:energy} then becomes:

 \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy}
 \begin{split}
E_{NR} &= f W (n_{\gamma} + n_{e} ) \\
   &= f W (\frac{S1}{g_{1}} + \frac{S2}{g_{2}})
 \end{split}
\end{equation}

This equation can be rewritten:

 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:combined_energy}
E_{NR} = f E_{ER} = \frac{E_{ER}}{\mathcal{L}}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}$ is Lindhard's factor. Lindhard's factor accounts for the fraction of energy lost to atomic motion (heat) in nuclear recoils \cite{Lindhard1963}. An incoming particle interacts with a ``patient zero'' Xe atom, resulting a nuclear recoil. The patient zero Xe atom interacts with surrounding atoms in a cascade to produce S1 and S2; it is the energy partitioning in this cascade that results in different energy scales for \ac{ER} and \ac{NR}. Lindhard shows that the energy partitioned in nuclear interactions and electron interactions from a recoiling xenon nucleus is:

 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:lindhard}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{k g(\epsilon)}{1 + k g(\epsilon)}
\end{equation}

where $k = 0.133 Z^{2/3} A^{-1/2}$ is a proportionality constant that relates electronic stopping power and the velocity of the recoiling xenon atom, and $\epsilon = 11.5 (E_{NR}/keV) Z^{-7/3}$. Lindhard's calculation yields $k=0.166$, which is the commonly accepted value. Measurements of nuclear recoils in \ac{LXe} are used to fit for $k$. Several experiments were compared by Sorensen and Dahl to determine that nuclear recoil energy is well described by $0.110 < k < 0.166$ \cite{Sorensen2011}. Results from \ac{LUX} yielded $k = 0.1735 \pm 0.0060$ \cite{LUX:DD}. 


If it is not known \textit{a priori} whether an interaction is a nuclear recoil or electron recoil, the `electron equivalent' energy is given in units $keV_{ee}$. If it is known that the recoil is a nuclear recoil, Lindhard's factor is applied and the units are given $keV_{nr}$. Lindhard's factor allows us to combine nuclear recoils and electronic recoils on one scale by labelling contours of constant reconstructed energy with both $keV_{ee}$ and $keV_{nr}$ (example in Figure~\ref{fig:e_contours}).

\section{Dual-Phase Xenon TPCs for Dark Matter Detection}
Dual phase Xe \ac{TPC}s have been at the forefront of the hunt for dark matter in the last several decades. As described above, the xenon medium and detector technology make excellent low-background, rare-event searches with high signal yields. Dual phase Xe \ac{TPC}s also provide a few enhancements to WIMP dark matter searches, but other dark matter or rare event searches are also possible with the same detector.


\subsection{WIMP Searches with LXe TPCs}
Dual-phase \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s are optimized for WIMP searches. They have been very successful in reaching large areas of WIMP parameter space. 

\subsubsection{ER, NR Discrimination}
\label{sec:er_nr_discrimination}
One of the most powerful features of \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s, which has made the technology especially useful in the hunt for WIMP dark matter, is the ability to discriminate between electron recoils and nuclear recoils. \ac{WIMP} interactions are expected to be nuclear recoils, but most natural radioactivity ($\beta , \gamma$) are electron recoils. The amount of recombination for equal energy \ac{ER} and \ac{NR} is different, so for events with the same reconstructed energy $E$(keV$_{ee}$), the ratio of S2/S1 is characteristically different. A useful discrimination space is log$_{10}$(S2/S1) vs S1, as the distributions of log$_{10}$(S2/S1) for \ac{ER} and \ac{NR} events are Gaussian. Different calibration sources are used to develop a population of events known to be \ac{ER} and a population of events known to be \ac{NR}, these calibration sources reveal what is known as the \ac{ER} and \ac{NR} bands (Figure~\ref{fig:bands}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figures/lxetpcs/bands.png}
\caption{Plot showing ER and NR bands from LUX. Solid lines are the ER and NR Gaussian means $\mu$, dotted lines are $\mu \pm 1 \sigma$. Figure from \cite{LUX:YieldsAndRecombination} }
\label{fig:bands}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


In the course of a \ac{WIMP} search, the experimentalists are tasked with keeping a stable detector operating for months or years. In this time, the detector will see events of natural radioactivity and perhaps \ac{WIMP}s. The natural radioactivity appears in the \ac{ER} band (location of bands is known from calibration), and nuclear recoil events appear in the \ac{NR} band. Due to band overlap, only events appearing below the \ac{NR} mean are considered \ac{WIMP} candidates. This restriction cuts signal acceptance to 50\%, but allows dual-phase \ac{TPC}s to reject background electronic recoils at $\gtrsim$99\%. The background acceptance rate is known as \ac{ER} leakage. It is the fraction of events appearing below the \ac{NR} mean from the \ac{ER} calibration source. For a background rejection rate of 99.99\%, the \ac{ER} leakage is 0.01\%, this number determines the sensitivity of the detector.


\subsubsection{WIMP Rates and Cross Section}
\label{sec:wimp_rates}
The choice of direct detection for \ac{WIMP} searches was touched on \ref{chapter 1 section about direct detection}. Here, we go through the specifics of \ac{WIMP} rates and their cross section in \ac{LXe}, showing that the \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC} technology gets an enhancement that makes it especially suited for \ac{WIMP} searches.

\ac{WIMP}s scattering in the \ac{TPC} produce measurable nuclear recoils. The shape of this nuclear recoil spectrum determines eventually the number of \ac{WIMP} events observed, and it depends on both \ac{WIMP} properties and detector properties. The energy imparted to nucleus depends on \ac{WIMP} mass $M_{\chi}$ and velocity distribution, as well as the mass of the target nucleus $M_{T}$ and a nuclear form factor $F$ that governs how effectively energy is transferred to the nucleus. Assuming a uniform, spherical dark matter halo, estimates for the local density of dark matter $\rho{\chi}$ can be made from astrophysical observations. The velocity distribution $f(v)$ is assumed to be isotropic and Maxwellian, with a cut-off at the escape velocity $v_{esc}$ of the Milky Way. If we account for the velocity of the Earth through the galactic plane $v_{E}$, the velocity distribution is shifted: $f(v) = f(v,v_{E})$. Following Lewin and Smith \cite{Lewin1996}, we can write the local number density:


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
dn &= \frac{n_{0}}{k} f(v, v_{E}) d^{3}v \\
     &= \frac{n_{0}}{k} exp \big( - \frac{(v + v_{E})^{2} }{ v_{0}^{2}} \big) d^{3}v 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $n_{0} = p_{\chi}/M_{\chi}$ is the average local number density of dark matter particles, $v_{0} \approx~220km/s$ \cite{?} is the mean of the dark matter velocity distribution, and $k$ is a normalization constant such that $\int_{0}^{v_{esc}} \equiv n_{0}$. If the escape velocity is infinite, the normalization integral is easily evaluated:

\begin{equation}
k = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{-1}^{1i} d(cos\theta)  \int_{0}^{\infty} f(v, v_{E}) v^{2}dv = (\pi v_{0}^{2})^{3/2} \equiv k_{0}
\end{equation}

$v_{esc}$ is not infinite ($v_{esc} \approx 544~km/s$ \cite{Baudis2014}), and so the normalization integral evaluates to:

\begin{equation}
k =  k_{0} \Big[ erf\big(\frac{v_{esc}}{v_{0}}\big) - \frac{2}{\pi^{1/2}} \frac{v_{esc}}{v_{0}} exp(- v_{exc}^{2} / v_{0}^{2} ) \Big]  \equiv k_{1}
\end{equation}

Although this is a more complicated expression, it should be noted the difference between $k_{0}$ and $k_{1}$ is less than \~0.5\%. We now have a full picture of the local number density of dark matter, and we focus on the scattering rate in the detector. If we let $\sigma$ be the scattering cross-section per nucleus (the details of $\sigma$ are discussed later), the event rate per unit mass detector with target mass $M_{T}$ is:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:rate}
%\begin{split}
%R &= \frac{N_{A}}{A} \sigma \int v~dn \\
%&= \frac{N_{A}}{A} \sigma n_{0} \langle v \rangle
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rate}
%\begin{split}
%dR &= \frac{N_{A}}{A} \sigma  v~dn \\
dR = \frac{1}{M_{T}} \sigma  v~dn 
%\end{split}
\end{equation}

%where $N_{A}$ is Avogadro's number. 
%It is useful to define $R_{0}$ for the test case $v_{E} = 0$ and $v_{esc} = \infty$:

%\begin{equation}
%R_{0} = \frac{\pi^{1/2}}{2} \frac{N_{0}}{A} \frac{\rho_{\chi}}{M_{\chi}} \sigma v_{0}
%\%end{equation}

%This allows us to re-write Equation~\ref{eq:rate} as:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:integral_rate}
%\begin{split}
%R &= R_{0} \frac{\pi^{1/2}}{2} \frac{ \langle v \rangle }{v_{0}} \\
%   &=  R_{0} \frac{k_{0}}{k} \frac{1}{2\pi v_{0}^{4}} \int v f(v, v_{E}) d^{3}v
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}

%This is the differential rate per unit mass scattering in the target, but t
The experimentalist is concerned with the observable recoil energy spectrum produced by such a dark matter rate. A \ac{WIMP} of mass $M_{\chi}$ and initial energy $E_{\chi} = \frac{1}{2}M_{\chi}v^{2}$ scattering at angle $\theta$ (in the center-of-mass frame) will impart a recoil energy $E_{R}$ to a target nucleus of $M_{T}$

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:recoil}
E_{R} = r E_{\chi} \frac{1 - cos\theta}{2}
\end{equation}

Where $r$ is the kinematic factor:

\begin{equation}
r = \frac{ 4 M_{\chi}M_{T} }{ (M_{\chi} + M_{T})^{2}}
\end{equation}

Note that the kinematic factor indicates that recoil energies are greatest for $M_{\chi} \approx M_{T}$. SUSY models favor \ac{WIMP} masses in the range 100GeV-1000GeV (Figure~\ref{fig:WIMPblobs}), which makes xenon ($M_{Xe} \approx$ 123 GeV) an excellent target. \ac{WIMP} scatters are assumed to be isotropic, so recoil energies are distributed uniformly in the range $0 < E_{R} < rE_{\chi}$ (i.e. Equation~\ref{eq:recoil} for $0 < cos\theta < 1$). We can put this together with Equation~\ref{rq:rate} to arrive at an differential rate per recoil energy in the detector -- i.e. the observable recoil spectrum for \ac{WIMP}-nucleus scattering. Note that equation Equation~\ref{rq:rate} is in terms of the \ac{WIMP} velocity $v$ and Equation~\ref{eq:recoil} is in terms of \ac{WIMP} energy $E_{\chi} = \frac{1}{2}M_{\chi}v^{2}$, so a change of variables is required. After the variable change, we can write:

\begin{equation}
\label{ref:dRdEr}
\frac{dR}{dE_{R}} =  \frac{\rho_{\chi}}{M_{\chi}} \frac{\sigma}{k} \Big( \frac{ M_{T} + M_{\chi}}{M_{T} M_{\chi}} \Big)^{2} \int_{v_{min}}^{v_{max}} \frac{1}{v} f(v,v_{E}) d^{3}v
\end{equation}

Until now, we have left off discussion of the \ac{WIMP}-nucleus cross section $\sigma$. Equation~\ref{ref:dRdEr}, as it stands is the \ac{WIMP} spectrum in the limit of billiard-ball coherent scattering. In reality, nucleus has structure which must be accounted for, which is accomplished with a nuclear form factor $F = F(q)$. In addition, the cross-section is split into spin-independent ($\sigma_{SI}$) and spin-dependent ($\sigma_{SD}$) components:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sigma_{SI}F^{2}_{SI}(q) + \sigma_{SD}F^{2}_{SD}(q)
\end{equation}

The nuclear form factor, $F(q)_{SI, SD}$, decreases the cross section at higher momentum transfer. The two coherent terms $\sigma_{SI}$ and  $\sigma_{SD}$ are parametrized as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sigma_{SI} &= \frac{4 \mu^{2} }{\pi} [ (A-Z) f_{n} + Zf_{p}]^{2} \\
 & \approx \frac{4 \mu^{2} A^{2}}{\pi} f_{n}^{2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $\mu$ is the usual reduced mass, and the second line takes into account that for \ac{SUSY} \ac{WIMP} models, the couplings to neutrons and protons are approximately equal ($f_{n} \approx f_{p}$).

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{SD} = \frac{32 G_{F} \mu^{2}}{\pi} \frac{J+1}{J} [\langle s_{n} \rangle a_{n} + \langle s_{p} \rangle a_{p}] ^{2}
\end{equation}

Where $G_{F}$ is the Fermi constant, $J$ is the total nuclear spin of the target, and $\langle s_{n,p} \rangle$ and $a_{n,p}$ represent values for neutron and proton spins and couplings, respectively. It should be noted that $\sigma_{SI}$ scales as $A^{2}$, which indicates a cross-section enhancement for larger targets. $\sigma_{SD}$ lacks the $A^{2}$ scaling, and is smaller $\sigma_{SI}$. This indicates that recoil-rates are dominated by spin-dependent interactions. The two cases are treated separately, with collaborations releasing both spin-independent and spin-dependent \ac{WIMP} limits. in liquid xenon detectors, the odd-numbered nuclei $^{129}Xe$ and $^{131}Xe$ contribute to the spin-dependent rate.

\subsection{Other Dark Matter Searches with LXe TPCs}
The available \ac{SUSY} parameter space has dwindled greatly in the last few decades, due in large part to the success of this detector technology. Coupled with no observation of \ac{SUSY} at the \ac{LHC}, experimentalists are beginning to look to other models and parameter spaces for dark matter. New technologies are being developed and refined for new dark matter candidates, but already existing, well-understood detector technologies such as dual-phase \ac{TPC}s can also be employed in the search for non-\ac{WIMP} dark matter. 

In their first \ac{WIMP} search results, the Xenon10 collaborationIn imposed an analysis threshold of $4.5~keV_{nr}$ \cite{Xenon10WIMP}. The first \ac{LUX} results set an analysis threshold of $4.3~keV_{nr}$ (with 2 < S1 (phd) < 30 and S2 (phd) > 200; S2 (electrons) $\gtrsim$ 8) \cite{LUXFirstResults}. The first Xenon100 results set an analysis threshold of $8.7~keV_{nr}$ (4 < S1(phd) < 20 and S2 (phd) > 300; S2(electrons) $\gtrsim$ 10) \cite{Xenon100FirstResults}. Such thresholds are common practice, and are set by the light-collection efficiency of the detector; the detection threshold is much lower. Dual-phase \ac{TPC}s are sensitive to events which produce a single electron, due to the internal amplification of the S2 signal; the reason for setting analysis thresholds is to ensure the presence of an S1 in the event. Without both and S1 and S2 in the event, the full (x,y,z) position cannot be re-constructed, and so a fiducial cut cannot be applied. Sorensen showed that the Xenon10 S2 pulse width carries a mild z-dependence \cite{Sorensen2010}, and so larger detectors with a long drift time may gain reliable z-position reconstruction via S2 pulse width \cite{SorensenS2Width}. Improvements in analysis techniques such as this allow dual-phase xenon \ac{TPC}s to reach lower \ac{WIMP} masses, and even other dark matter models. 

In 2011 the Xenon10 collaboration presented a search for low-mass (\~5 - 20 GeV) dark matter \cite{Angle2011}. The detector conditions were distinct from the Xenon10 \ac{WIMP} search in \cite{Xenon10WIMP}: the secondary scintillation gain was about 12\% higher, and the S2-sensitive trigger threshold was set at the level of a single electron. With this, the collaboration carried out a standard \ac{WIMP} analysis (i.e one based on the procedure presented in \ref{sec:wimp_rates}), with a lowered S2 analysis threshold of 4 electrons ($1.4~keV_{nr}$). Why they did not proceed down to the detection threshold of 1 electron is very interesting; and is discussed further in Chapter~\ref{ch:etrains}. Since Xenon10 is a small detector, they were not able to take advantage of S2-width z-correlations, but they employed a radial fiducial cut and other analysis techniques to produce the result in Figure~\ref{fig:xenon10lowmass}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}


A few years later, Essig et al. used the information reported in \cite{Angle2011} and other Xenon10 publications to produce the first direct detection limits of sub-Gev dark matter \cite{Essig2012}. The detection threshold for \ac{WIMP}s in \ac{LXe} decreases sharply for $M_{WIMP} \lesssim 10~GeV$; however, this detection threshold is based on the assumption that the dark matter is interacting only with the xenon nucleus. If sub-GeV dark matter scatters with atomic \textit{electrons}, as opposed to nuclei, then it can produce observable signals of a few electrons; in \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s the S1 signal is lost due to light collection, and the few electron signals are observable as S2s. The approach in the paper is to follow approximately the same procedure as in Section~ \ref{sec:wimp_rates}, with a few but significant substitutions. The $E_{R}$ in Equation~\label{eq:recoil} must now account for the binding energy of the electron, and take a different form to refer to the recoil of the electron and not the nucleus. The cross section of interest is now $\sigma_{e}$, the sum over all of the differential ionization cross sections for electrons in the (n, l) shell. For a dark photon with mass $O$(MeV-GeV) coupled to the visible sector via kinetic mixing (a very generic class of standard model extensions discussed in $Chapter~\ref{darkphotons}$, Essig et al. set the exclusion limit in the $m_{DM}-\sigma_{e}$ plane in Figure~\ref{subGeV} (left). If there is some momentum-transfer enhancement due to e.g. scattering through an electric-dipole moment, $\sigma_{e} \longrightarrow \sigma_{e}F_{DM}(q) \equiv \bar{\sigma_{e}}$. Essig set exclusion limits for such dark matter candidates in Figure~\ref{subGeV} (right).

In addition to the dark sector, dual-phase \ac{TPC}s can search for other dark matter signals with scattering on electrons. Annual modulation searches (in \ac{ER} or \ac{NR}) can provide clues to dark matter. Such searches take advantage of the fact that $v_{E}$ varies with the rotation of the earth around the sun, reaching a maximum in June and minimum in December. The modulation in $v_{E}$ leads to a modulation in the recoil rate observed in the detector. Searches for dark matter-induced rate modulations can offer a generic approach to identify dark matter interactions, complementary to the model-driven dark matter searches. The \ac{LUX} experiment did such a search, looking at \ac{ER} modulations in an energy rage of interest (2-6~$keV_{ee}$). This energy range was chosen to overlap with the DAMA/LIBRA Collaboration's long-standing and controversial claim of dark matter modulation on a target of NaI(Tl), which appears strongest around a recoil energy of 3~$keV_{ee}$. \ac{LUX} found no significant indication of rate modulation \cite{LUXModulation}. If future large dual-phase \ac{TPC}s like XenonNT and LZ observe a \ac{NR} \ac{WIMP} signal, the additional positive identification of a modulation signal of the \ac{NR} signal would be a smoking-gun for \ac{WIMP} discovery. 

Another dark matter candidate that could produce an electron recoil signal in xenon is the axion (or more generally, axion-like-particles). For searches such as these, a signal model is produced from the spectrum of axions from different sources, such as galactic axions or solar axions. The resulting signal model is an \ac{ER} spectrum accounts for finite detector energy resolution and threshold. The signal model spectrum is compared to the observed \ac{ER} spectrum in the appropriate energy ranges, resulting in a confidence statement mass of the axion $m_{A}$ and the axio-electric coupling $g_{Ae}$. The results of searches for solar axion and galactic axion signals are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:axions}.

Finally, a model-independent search for \ac{LIP}s is possible in dual-phase xenon \ac{TPC}. As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter 1 lip section}, \ac{LIP}s appear in dark sector models with a masses dark photon, where another dark sector particle $\chi$ couples to the standard model electron via kinetic mixing of the dark photon and standard model photon. \ac{LIP}s deposit energies that can be described with particles of effective fractional charge. Chapter~\ref{ch:lips} describes the signal model and analysis method to search for \ac{LIP}s in \ac{LUX}.
