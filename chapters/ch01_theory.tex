\section{A Little History}
Our understanding of the universe develops in a leap-frog of theory and observation, one catching up to and surpassing the other as technology improves, to be passed in turn by a new idea or new observation. 


\section{The Standard Cosmology}
The standard cosmology is a parametrization of the Big-Bang cosmological model is also referred to as $\Lambda$CDM ("Lambda-CDM") and it accounts for the observed:

\begin{itemize}
\item cosmic microwave background (CMB)
\item large scale structure of galaxies and clusters
\item accelerating expansion of the universe
\item abundances of hydrogen and helium
\end{itemize}

Since the CMB was discovered in 1965
