This Thesis is laid out in three main sections. The first section deals with the evidence for dark matter, theoretical background for different dark matter candidates, and an overview of experimental strategies to detect dark matter, going into detail for one particular detection strategy, the dual-phase \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}.

The second section, Big Science, delves into details about the \ac{LUX} detector, a dual-phase \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}, and presents a search for the \ac{LIP} dark matter candidated carried out with \ac{LUX} data.

The last section, Little Science, describes an R\&D test bed that was built at \ac{LBNL} over the course of this PhD and describes two studies completed with the test bed.
