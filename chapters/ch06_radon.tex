\chapter{Solubility of Radon Daughters in Liquid Xenon}\label{ch:radon} % $\mathbb{ZNR}$
%************************************************
Rare-event searches are very sensitive to backgrounds from radioactivity in and on detector materials. Some of the most omnipresent and troublesome are $^{222}$Rn and its daughters. Decay products from $^{222}$Rn plate out on detector surfaces and have typically been assumed to be fixed there (plate out is further defined in Section~\ref{sec:plateout}). In this chapter, a series of experiments is described; the results provide evidence that radon daughters are mobile in liquid xenon after having been fixed to a surface.

\section{Motivation}
Radon and radon daughters produce problematic backgrounds for rare-event searches \cite{LUXFirstResults}. Of particular concern for liquid xenon dark matter detectors are ``naked'' beta decays. These ground-state to ground-state decays have no accompanying gammas and cannot be rejected via coincidence tagging. Rejection of these backgrounds in WIMP search experiments relies solely on being able to discriminate electron recoils from nuclear recoils. For example, the \ac{ER} leakage fraction from the LUX Run03 tritium calibration is on the order of 2/1000 over the WIMP search region \cite{LUXTritium} (See Chapter~\ref{ch:lux} for more details about tritium calibration).  The $^{222}$Rn chain contains $^{210}$Pb ($T_{1/2} = $~22.23~y), effectively splitting the decay chain into a ``fast chain'' and ``slow chain'' (Figure~\ref{fig:Rn222}). Radon can be introduced via two pathways: (1) during detector construction and (2) during detector operation (see Figure~\ref{fig:flow_chart}). Great care is taken to ensure minimal contamination via pathway 2 because the fast chain naked betas, $^{214}$Pb and $^{214}$Bi, may decay in the fiducial volume before the purification system can remove them or before they can plate out on detector surfaces. In pathway 1, $^{222}$Rn and daughters plate out onto detector surfaces during construction of parts, and construction of the detector itself. Models for the plate out process can be found in \cite{Guiseppe:2011mj} and \cite{Knutson:1988}. Typically it is assumed that once $^{222}$Rn and daughters plate out, they remain fixed at that position, and can be rejected by a fiducial volume cut. This means that the slow chain naked betas of $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Bi from initial exposure during construction are assumed to occur outside the fiducial volume. However, evidence of $^{210}$Bi mobility has been observed in the liquid scintillator environment of KamLAND  \cite{Takemoto:2015gta}, \cite{Gando:2014wjd} and Borexino \cite{Bellini:2013lnn}. If radon daughters are soluble in liquid xenon, the late chain naked betas (from both pathway 1 and 2) pose a serious background distributed throughout the fiducial volume.

%While $^{222}$Rn has a half-life of 3.8~d, the long-lived daughter $^{210}$Pb ($T_{1/2} \approx$~22.3~y) can be a source of background events in even the longest running searches. Of particular concern for liquid xenon dark matter detectors are the ``naked'' beta decays of $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Bi. These ground-state to ground-state decays have no accompanying gammas and cannot be rejected via coincidence tagging. Rejection of these backgrounds in WIMP search experiments relies solely on being able to discriminate electron recoils from nuclear recoils. Typically it is assumed that once $^{222}$Rn and daughters plate out, they remain stuck to the surface, and can be rejected by a fiducial volume cut. However, evidence of $^{210}$Bi mobility has been observed in the liquid scintillator environment of KamLAND  \cite{Takemoto:2015gta}, \cite{Gando:2014wjd} and Borexino \cite{Bellini:2013lnn}. If radon daughters are soluble in liquid xenon, the naked beta decays of $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Bi pose a serious background distributed throughout the fiducial volume.

In order to investigate the mobility of radon daughters in liquid xenon, a $^{220}$Rn source was employed instead of $^{222}$Rn (see Figure~\ref{fig:Rn220}). The analogous long lived daughter in the $^{220}$Rn chain, $^{212}$Pb, has a half-life of 10.6~h, making it appropriate for a laboratory test. Investigating pathway 2 in the laboratory by introducing radon in a \ac{LXe} environment will necessarily yield inconclusive results, because it is impossible to tell if the daughter decay of interest plated out before decaying. Therefore, we required the radon daughters to be on a surface.

Xenon gas was circulated through the $^{220}$Rn source and detector components for a period of $>$24~h. The detector was then evacuated, thereby assuring the initial position of radon daughters on a detector surface. The study makes the assumption that any radon daughters subsequently observed in the bulk region after condensing liquid xenon must therefore have dissolved.

%There are two main pathways to radon contamination for rare-event searches with liquid xenon time projection chambers (LXe TPCs):

%1. During construction, radon plates out onto detector surfaces. This radon and subsequent daughters are assumed to remain stuck in a liquid xenon environment.

%2. During operation, radon that emanates into the detector volume decays wherever it is deposited by circulation and/or convection currents. In LXe TPCs, a drift field in the large bulk region drifts the 75\% of charged radon daughters towards the bottom of the detector, where they are then assumed to remain. The radon daughters that are not charged remain in the bulk region, where they then have the chance to be removed by the detector purification system. 

%Testing pathway 2 by depositing radon into a liquid xenon environment will yield inconclusive results. A radon daughter decay purposely deposited in the bulk cannot be distinguished from a radon daughter which dissolved into the liquid after plating out at the bottom of the detector. Therefore, we focus on pathway 1 by only introducing radon in a gas environment, thereby assuring its initial position on a detector surface. Then any radon daughters observed in the bulk region after condensing liquid xenon are candidates for having dissolved.
%tentative statement: testing pathway \#2 is always going to be inconclusive because ... therefore we focus on pathway \#1.

\subsection{Plate Out}
\label{sec:plateout}
The term ``plate out'' is used above but not defined. The literature indicates that there two known types of radon daughter plate out \cite{Samuelsson1996}. The following terms are used in \cite{Samuelsson1996} to identify each type.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{implantation:} Alpha recoil implantation of a daughter nucleus.
\item \textit{sticking:} Daughters are sitting on the surface of a material; it is possible to wash a percentage of these off with various surface cleaning methods.
\end{enumerate}

The percentages of daughters plated out in these different modes are not indicated, but \cite{Samuelsson1996} relates a story of researchers being unable to remove $^{214}$Po from glass samples, whereas $^{218}$Po was easily removed with surface cleaning methods. This is explained by the fact that further down the $^{222}$Rn chain, more alpha decays have occurred, so a late-stage daughter has had more chances to be implanted. It is also noted that the durability of the implanted activity is subject to change under different conditions, as is the implant integrity. The author cites factors such as humidity and temperature affecting whether daughters implant, and whether they remain implanted; since the conditions for plate out are different in pathways 1 and 2 it logical to infer that implantation functions differently in these two environments for \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s. 

The chemistry of radon has been studied as well, and may provide some context to the plate-out discussion. Radon is frequently regarded as a totally inert element. It is, however, classified as a ``metalloid", and exhibits some of the characteristics of both true metals and nonmetals  \cite{stein1987}. For example, it is known to react chemically with fluorine, halogen fluorides, dioxygenyl salts, fluoro-nitrogen salts, and halogen fluoride-metal fluoride complexes to form ionic compounds \cite{stein1982}. It is also known to co-crystalize with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide \cite{stein1987}. In the latter case, the author notes that the radon is not forming true chemical bonds, but rather is held in place by weak Van der Waals forces. These chemical experiments found radon to be readily reactive at ``room temperature and lower", but the low temperate range is not stated. It is clear that chemical / Van der Waals bonds formed by radon belong in the `sticking' class of radon plate out, as opposed to implantation.

If we look to surface physics, the plate-out term `sticking' is well defined by the terms physisorption and chemisorption. Physisorption is distinct from chemisorption in that it is a general phenomenon occurring between the adsorbed atom and surface, while chemisorption involves a chemical reaction between surface and adsorbate, and is characterized by higher bond strengths. Chemisorption potentials have been calculated for many atoms and surfaces \cite{HammerNorskov} and are generally greater than 1~eV. Physisorption potentials, such as the well-known Van der Waals potential, are less than 1~eV and as low as 10~meV. 

Plate out occurs with different rates on different materials \cite{Bigu1987}, and can be an order of magnitude larger on \ac{PTFE} than stainless steel, likely due to \ac{PTFE} tendency to accumulate negative static charge \cite{Morrison2017}. Plate out of radon daughters can be reduced by employing a nitrogen gas purge or an electric field (approximately 90\% of radon daughters are charged) \cite{Bruemmer2015}. However, \cite{Bigu1987}, \cite{Morrison2017}, and \cite{Bruemmer2015} do not distinguish between implantation and sticking, and only use the term ``plate out''. 


\section{Experimental Configuration and Method}
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/radon/internals.png}
    \caption{Diagram of the test bed. For this study, the cathode is held at -6.0~kV, and the grid is held at -4.0~kV. E$_{1}^{liq} \approx $5.0~kV/cm, E$_{1}^{gas} \approx $10.0~kV/cm E$_{2}$ = 1.0~kV/cm. E$_{3}$ = 2.7~kV/cm. The large gray regions represent the structural rings of \acs{PTFE}. The line between the grid and anode represents the liquid xenon level. The xenon inlet pipes incoming gas directly into the liquid region, and the liquid outlet pulls from the level of the active region. A gas outlet (not pictured) also draws xenon gas into the circulation system to be purified.}
    \label{fig:anode_and_grids}
\end{figure}

A diagram of the \ac{TPC} for this work is shown in Figure~$\ref{fig:anode_and_grids}$. A 50~mm diameter cathode wire grid, extraction wire grid, and a planar, segmented anode were held in Teflon \ac{PTFE} housing. The anode was instrumented with charge-sensitive preamplifiers. Both grids were constructed from a stainless steel frame strung with 4~$\mu$m diameter stainless steel wire on a 2~mm pitch. The xenon inlet was a \ac{PTFE} tube which introduced xenon gas into the liquid region where it was condensed. The xenon liquid outlet was a thin stainless steel capillary that drew liquid from the \ac{TPC} into the purification system. Both inlet and outlet tubes were placed near holes drilled in the \ac{PTFE} to aid circulation into the active volume.

Recall from Chapter~\ref{ch:LXeTPCs} that a particle interaction in liquid xenon produces primary scintillation photons (S1) and ionization electrons. The ionization electrons are drifted with an electric field into the gas phase, where they produce secondary scintillation light (S2). A single Hamamatsu R8778 \ac{VUV}-sensitive \ac{PMT} was installed in Teflon \ac{PTFE} housing, facing upward to view the active region. Directly above the \ac{PMT} was a copper shield mask, held at the same voltage as the \ac{PMT} bias of -1250~V. Recall from Chapter~\ref{ch:testbed} that this test bed has a segmented anode instrumented with charge amplifiers installed at the top of the gas region. The segments are concentric rings, and provide a way to localize events in $(x,y)$. The charge amplifiers produce raw and amplified signals. The amplified signals are shaped by a gaussian amplifier with a module to restore the baseline; the shaped shaped signals can be used as a trigger to select events in a specific $(x,y)$ region. 

%During data-taking, the cathode, grid, and anode were were held at -6.0~kV, -4.0~kV, and 0~V, respectively. 


%A cathode wire grid was held in place 1~cm above the PMT shield. An extraction wire grid was held 1~cm above the cathode grid. A planar, segmented anode was held 0.5~cm above the extraction grid and instrumented with charge-sensitive preamplifiers. Both grids were constructed from a stainless steel frame strung with 4~$\mu$m diameter stainless steel wire on a 2mm pitch. 


%The Cirlex {\color{red} [it is made of G10]} anode has three segments, which directly measure charge. Each segment is read out via a charge-sensitive preamplifier. The readout segments are concentric: channel 1 is the central circle, channel 2 is the ring around it, and channel 3 is the outermost ring. The extraction grid has the dual purpose of creating a higher field than the drift region to extract electrons into the gas region of the TPC, as well as being used as a Frisch grid to reduce the z-dependence of charge measurement. The voltage of the extraction grid relative to the cathode is determined by Bunneman's equation for grid transparency (Ref here?).

%An outer stainless steel vessel surrounding the TPC is kept at vacuum.

The \ac{TPC} was filled with 1.5~bar of xenon gas at room temperature. The gas was circulated continuously through the \ac{TPC} and a heated zirconium getter for at least 24 hours to remove contaminants. The \ac{TPC} was then cooled to $-100^{\circ}$~C while circulating xenon gas. Circulation was stopped, and xenon was condensed into the \ac{TPC} until the liquid level rose to between the extraction grid and anode. The process of filling the \ac{TPC} took 4 to 5 hours. The liquid level was kept stable by keeping the temperature and pressure constant in the \ac{TPC}. During data collection, xenon from the \ac{TPC} was continually circulated through a getter and re-condensed into the \ac{TPC} to remove impurities. %A capillary circulates xenon from the liquid region and an additional, separate valve circulates gaseous xenon from column of gas above the active region to prevent stagnation. This circulation line bypasses an $^{220}$Rn flow-through source. If desired, the flow can be switched from the bypass line to the source, bringing $^{220}$Rn into the TPC. The circulation path is through the source during plate-out, described below, and through the bypass during data-taking.

A gas purge also purified the gas column in the detector.}

\subsection{Plate Out of $^{220}$Rn Daughters}
\label{plateout}
The procedure to plate out $^{220}$Rn daughters on the inner surfaces of the detector was the same as described above, except that the circulation path was directed through a 2~kBq $^{220}$Rn source. The $^{220}$Rn decay scheme is shown in Figure~$\ref{fig:Rn220}$. The rate of radon activity in the \ac{TPC} was measured to be $4.5\pm0.5$~Hz during plate out. The total alpha rate was measured by taking repeated 1200~ms traces on an oscilloscope of the PMT with a falling edge trigger and counting the alpha decays. This rate was then halved to get the rate of radon decays. The half factor was necessary because the $^{216}$Po alpha decay followed $^{220}$Rn decay within the time window on the oscilloscope. The $4.5\pm0.5$~Hz rate of radon activity represents activity for all of the space internal to the \ac{PTFE} support structure. Decay daughters diffused until they contacted a wall or other surface, where they could plate out. Some percentage of decay daughters are expected to be positively charged ions. If the cathode grid was biased, charged decay daughters drifted preferentially to the cathode grid. The cathode voltage during plate outs is noted in Table $\ref{T:1}$.

    \label{fig:Rn220}
\end{figure}

Prior to filling the \ac{TPC} with liquid xenon, the circulation was stopped and the xenon gas removed from the \ac{TPC} and the circulation lines. A vacuum pressure of a few $10^{-4}$~Torr was achieved in a period of ten minutes. This step ensured removal of $^{220}$Rn and decay daughters which are dissolved in the gas, leaving only those daughters which had plated out on a detector surface. Since the fill time of the \ac{TPC} is 4 to 5 hours, there were no fast chain alpha decays of $^{220}$Rn and $^{216}$Po in the plate out data. Additional details are summarized in Table~$\ref{T:1}$.

Data set D was taken following dataset A, and radon was circulated in a liquid xenon environment, purposefully introducing radon into the detector bulk to calibrate the detector response. The errors in livetime come from the fact that it is not recorded when datasets ended, only when they started. The error accounts for a new data set not beginning promptly after another dataset finishes.}

\end{table}


\subsection{Data Collection}
\label{datacollection}
Voltage records from \ac{PMT} and charge channels were collected with a 14-bit ADC with 125~MHz sampling and a 20~MHz low-pass filter. The trigger was a coincidence between the \ac{PMT}  and the central anode segment, used to select events in the central ($r<3$~mm) column of xenon. This avoids any electric field fringing effects. %and also minimizes any variation in S2 size f. 

\subsection{Calibration}
In order to identify a signal region for bulk radon daughters, the flow though $^{220}$Rn source was employed directly following dataset A, allowing $^{220}$Rn to flow into the liquid bulk of the \ac{TPC}. The bulk daughter decay of interest, $^{212}$Bi alpha, has an energy approximately equal to the $^{220}$Rn alpha decay. The alpha signals were sufficient to saturate the biasing circuit of the \ac{PMT}, so alpha decays within 1~MeV of each other were indistinguishable. Therefore, the region in S1 area vs. S2 area where the bulk $^{220}$Rn alphas appeared was also where bulk $^{212}$Bi alphas were expected (Figure~$\ref{fig:all_plots_CD}$).

\subsection{Position Reconstruction}
The central anode segment was assumed to select events from the central column with 100\% efficiency. Events occurring under one of the outer concentric segments can produce a signal on the central anode, but the signal was largest at the anode segment nearest the charge. It was not required that there be zero signal on the outer segments, so the (x,y) position of the event is treated as a source of uncertainty, which is taken into account in the calculation of fiducial volume. The drift time of the events was calculated from the time difference between the S1 and S2 pulses, and a linear scaling of 2~mm/us was applied using the electron drift velocity in \ac{LXe} measurements in \cite{Aprile2010}. 

\subsection{Fiducial Volume}
Different values for the fiducial volume are presented below. Since there was no calibration to determine the efficiency at which the central anode segment responds to selected events from the central column, it is unclear what the true fiducial volume is.  In the future, a calibration scheme could be devised with the $^{210}$Po source discussed in the next chapter. The $^{210}$Po can be deposited on small segments of the grid wire. Depositions could be made at desired locations, i.e. radial distances from the central anode segment, and the response of the anode to a source at different locations could be characterized. For this study measurement, we fold in the uncertainty by calculating several possible fiducial volumes. If the central anode segment only detects events directly underneath it and no where else, then the fiducial volume is 0.39$\pm$0.03~mL. However, if the central anode segment reacted to events near the walls, the fiducial volume is the entire active region, 25.3$\pm$1.8~mL.

\section{Analysis}
\label{S:3}
\subsection{Number of $^{220}$Rn daughters in the TPC}
As described in Section~\ref{plateout}, the rate of $^{220}$Rn in the \ac{TPC} was measured to be 4.5$\pm$0.5~Hz during  plate out. From this, the number of daughter atoms $^{212}$Pb and $^{212}$Bi present in the \ac{TPC} just prior to filling the liquid xenon were calculated. The number of daughter atoms as a function of the plate out time is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plate_out} along with the data acquisition periods for each dataset. This calculation assumes that the diffusion time in the \ac{PTFE} walls was less than the removal time via the capillary, so the daughter of any decay that occurs in the \ac{TPC} remains in the \ac{TPC}.

%, and is an upper bound because some of the daughters are swept with the gaseous xenon through the circulation system and removed by the getter, or similarly removed with the pump out step prior to data taking. There is no way to accurately estimate the number of $^{212}$Bi atoms deposited on detector surfaces, so we use the upper bound in the calculation of percent of dissolved $^{212}$Bi below.

\subsection{Data Selection}
The trigger described in Section~\ref{datacollection} captured the slow chain decays as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Rn220}. The $^{212}$Bi beta decay is followed by the 300~ns alpha decay of $^{212}$Po; these decays are referred to herein as``Bi-Po".

The $^{212}$Bi beta decay is followed by the $^{212}$Po alpha in the same 76~$\mu$s event window; these decays are referred to herein as "Bi-Po".


The aim of this analysis was to reconstruct the z-position of radon daughter alpha decays via the timing difference between the S1 and S2 of an event. Therefore, Bi-Po events were rejected, as the two S2s presented a timing ambiguity. The focus was instead on identifying $^{212}$Bi alpha decays. All events were expected to take place on detector surfaces, so $^{212}$Bi alpha decays in the drift region indicate mobility of plated-out daughters $^{212}$Pb and/or $^{212}$Bi; it was not possible to determine whether the original position was on the cathode wires, \ac{PTFE} walls, or other detector surface.

%Because many of the events take place on the cathode grid wires, decreased light collection caused by the wires (shadowing) and high, non-uniform fields complicate the light and charge yields, and therefore accurate energy reconstruction of events on the cathode wires is is hampered (discussed further below).

The software cuts used to select $^{212}$Bi alphas and reject all other $^{220}$Rn slow chain decays are described below: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Data Cleaning} Remove events with any railed charge channel.
\item \textbf{Fiducialization} Require more signal in the central anode segment than the other two concentric anode segments.
\item \textbf{Select Alpha Events} The tallest pulse in an event was required to be an S1. Alphas are higher energy than the other decays in the $^{220}$Rn chain, and have a characteristically high light yield, so this cut is generous in keeping all alpha events. S1s were distinguished from S2s by requiring a high percentage of the total pulse area to lie in the first 10~samples of the pulse. This is referred to as a prompt fraction cut.
\item \textbf{Reject Bi-Po Topology} Of the alpha events, those with one S1 and one S2 (single-scatter) were classified as $^{212}$Bi alpha. Events with two S1s (one of which is alpha-like), and one or two S2s were classified as Bi-Po.
\item \textbf{Reject Bi-Po Energy} There are two ways a Bi-Po event can mimic the topology of $^{212}$Bi alpha: (i) alpha decay was prompt and so the scintillation signals from the beta and alpha were combined into one large S1 (ii) the beta was ejected into the cathode wire and therefore there was no signal detectable from the beta. To robustly identify $^{212}$Bi, the alpha S1 areas of $^{212}$Bi alpha and Bi-Po events from Step 2 were histogrammed and fit with Gaussian functions. $^{212}$Bi alpha events were tightly selected with a high and low S1 area cut placed on single-scatter alpha events: anything above $(\mu - 3\sigma)_{Bi-Po}$ was considered a Bi-Po event and anything below $(\mu - 3\sigma)_{Bi-alpha}$ was considered a beta or gamma, and discarded (Figure~\ref{fig:area_cut}). It should be noted that this cut doesn't affect the signal region for $^{212}$Bi alpha in bulk; it affects the region for $^{212}$Bi alpha on the cathode. This cut is conservative in discarding Bi-Po events, and this leads to a more conservative result for dissolved fraction of $^{212}$Bi alphas.
%Note that this step is only necessary if one wishes to count the number of $^{212}$Bi alphas observed on the cathode, where decreased light collection and high, non-uniform fields complicate the light and charge yields (S1 and S2 pulse areas). In the bulk region, a $^{212}$Bi alpha is easily distinguishable from a Bi-Po event with a prompt alpha because they differ by almost 3.0~MeV in energy.
\item \textbf{Z-position Cut} Events in the cathode region were separated from events in the bulk region with a z-position cut (discussed further below).
\item \textbf{Bulk Signal Area Cut} Only $^{212}$Bi alpha tagged events which also fell in a signal region expected from calibration with the $^{220}$Rn flow though source (Figure~\ref{fig:all_plots_CD}) were considered to be daughters which have dissolved.

%Before any S1 and S2 pulse area event selection, event topology was used to classify events.  Of the alpha events, those with one S1 and one S2 (single-scatter) are classified as $^{212}$Bi alpha. Events with two S1s (one of which is alpha-like), and one or two S2s are classified as Bi-Po. The alpha S1 areas of $^{212}$Bi alpha and Bi-Po events are histogrammed and fit with Gaussian functions (show figure of this?). At this point, it is possible that some events tagged as $^{212}$Bi alpha are actually Bi-Po events where the alpha decay is prompt and so the scintillation signals from the beta and alpha are combined into one large S1, or the beta is ejected into the cathode wire and therefore there is no signal detectable from the beta. In order to tightly select $^{212}$Bi alpha events, a high and low S1 area cut is placed on single-scatter alpha events: anything above $\mu_{Bi-Po} - 3\sigma_{Bi-Po}$ is considered a Bi-Po event and anything below $\mu_{Bi-alpha} - 3\sigma_{Bi-alpha}$ is considered a beta or gamma. Events in the cathode region are separated from events in the bulk region with a z-position cut (discussed below). These event topology and S1 area cuts and z-position cuts are as robust as the recombination physics allows for classifying $^{212}$Bi alpha and Bi-Po events on the cathode. In the bulk, a $^{212}$Bi alpha is easily distinguishable from a Bi-Po event with a prompt alpha because they differ by almost 3.0~MeV in energy. The unique light collection and recombination effects of the cathode make tagging difficult in the cathode region only. In order to avoid any other ambiguity for signal events ($^{212}$Bi alpha in the bulk region), only $^{212}$Bi alpha tagged events which also fall in a signal region expected from calibration with the $^{220}$Rn flow though source (Fig. $\ref{fig:signalregion_calib}$) are considered to be daughters which have dissolved.

%We focus on a search for $^{212}$Bi alpha decays. Because many of the events take place on the cathode grid wires, shadowing and high, non-uniform fields complicate the light and charge yields, and therefore accurate energy reconstruction of events on the cathode wires is is hampered. Therefore, before any S1 and S2 pulse area event selection, event topology is used to select candidate $^{212}$Bi alpha events. The simplest cut, which selects alpha events, requires the tallest pulse in an event to be an S1 and requires it to fall in a tight prompt fraction-pulse width region (show a figure of this?). Since alphas are known for their characteristic recombination with high (90\%) light yield only weakly dependent on field, this is more than generous in keeping all alpha events. Contamination from betas and gammas is possible, but unlikely. The second event topology cut requires only one S1 and one S2 in the event window, this cuts multi-scatter beta and gamma events as well as Bi-Po events. Events in the cathode region are separated from events in the bulk region with a z-position cut (see below for how this z is chosen). These event topology cuts and z-position cuts leave four possible event types that could mimic a $^{212}$Bi alpha decay in the bulk region:

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Cathode single scatter beta or gamma interactions mis-tagged as alphas (rare), with beta or gamma penetrating into the bulk region.
%\item Bulk single scatter beta or gamma interactions mis-tagged as alphas (rare).
%\item Overlapping Bi-Po in bulk region. This is where the $^{212}$Po alpha immediately follows the $^{212}$Bi beta, such that only one large (alpha-like) S1 appears. 
%\item Overlapping Bi-Po on cathode wire, with beta penetrating into the bulk region, thereby appearing to be a bulk event. 
%\end{enumerate}

%Events of types 2 and 3 are excluded by only choosing $^{212}$Bi alpha bulk events which fall within a signal region determined from calibration with the flow through source (Fig. $\ref{fig:signalregion_calib}$). Events of types 1 and 4 are excluded with the choice of $z$ that defines the cathode region from the bulk region. 

In order to choose the value for the z-position cut in Step 4, a Monte Carlo approach was used. A Bi-Po decay with a prompt alpha (appears as single-scatter) where the beta penetrates into the bulk region, could mimic a $^{212}$Bi alpha bulk event. To better understand Bi-Po cathode events and the danger of mis-identifying them as $^{212}$Bi alphas in bulk, a Monte Carlo study was done with the $^{212}$Bi beta spectrum (the highest energy beta in the $^{220}$Rn chain) to determine the maximum distance a beta could penetrate into the bulk region. The study yielded a maximum beta penetration of $zmax_{MC}$ = 0.12~cm, see Fig. $\ref{fig:betaMC}$. 
The $z$ position cut separating cathode from bulk was then defined to be $z_{cut} = zmax_{MC} + 3\sigma_{fit}$, where $\sigma_{fit}$ is just the width of a Gaussian fit for the position of the cathode. Figures $\ref{fig:all_plots_AB}$a and $\ref{fig:all_plots_AB}$c show the cathode position fits as well the the location of $z_{cut}$. The cathode position fit error, $\sigma_{fit}$, was the same for both datasets A and B, and was also used to determine $z_{cut}$ for the background and calibration sets.

%events are particularly easy to select because of the large S1, so we focus on a search for $^{212}$Bi in bulk.  $^{212}$Bi has a 0.36 branching ratio to a 6.2~MeV alpha and 0.64 branching ratio to a 2.9~MeV beta which is followed by the fast decay of $^{212}$Po via an 8.9~MeV alpha. This beta-alpha, referred to herein as "Bi-Po", occurs in the same event window
%This analysis reconstructs the z-position of $^{212}$Bi decays via the timing difference between the S1 and S2 of an event. Therefore, we reject BiPo events, the two S2s present a timing ambiguity. We expect all events to take place on the cathode; $^{212}$Bi alpha decays in the drift region indicate mobility of plated-out daughters $^{212}Pb$ and/or $^{212}$Bi.
%Sources of events that could mimic a $^{212}$Bi drift region event are
%(a) On the cathode: BiPo event with a prompt $^{212}$Po decay such that the beta S1 and alpha S1 (as well as their S2s) overlap. -- okay because we cut far enough away that the beta won't mimic 
%(b) The situation in (a) occurring in the drift region.
%0.57~MeV betas from $^{212}$Pb decay, 6.2~MeV alphas from one branch of $^{212}$Bi decay (0.36 brancing ratio), where the other branch (referred to as "Bi-Po") results in 2.9~MeV beta followed within the event window by a 8.9~MeV $^{212}$Po alpha. There is also a 1.8~MeV beta from $^{208}$Tl decay. Because many of the events take place on the cathode grid wires, shadowing and high, non-uniform fields complicate the light and charge yields, and therefore accurate energy reconstruction is is hampered. Before any energy-based event selection, event topology is used to select $^{212}$Bi alpha events. Bi-Po (beta-alpha) events are rejected for this analysis because the beta complicates z-position reconstruction.
%Most BiPo events can be cut via coincidence tagging, however, in the case of a prompt $^{212}$Po decay, PMT signals for the beta S1 and alpha S1 (as well as their S2s) could overlap, mimicking a $^{212}$Bi alpha decay. If these "fake" $^{212}$Bi alpha events were to happen in the drift region, the energy of the 8.9~MeV alpha would clearly identify it from the 6.2~MeV alpha. However, on the cathode, the unusual recombination could cause a mis-identification. This situation is of concern because betas travel further in liquid xenon that do alphas. Therefore, a Monte Carlo study was done for the $^{212}$Bi beta decay spectrum to determine the maximum depth into the drift region a beta on the cathode could penetrate (Fig. $\ref{fig:betaMC}$). The study selected an energy from the $^{212}$Bi beta spectrum (from IAEA), found the CDSA range for a beta of that energy (NIST), and then translated the CDSA range to actual depth by the method in Tabata (ref). The farthest such a beta could be expected to travel was found to be 0.12cm (0.6~us). Since the drift region of the detector measures 1.0~cm (6us) in depth, errant betas from the cathode do not pose a risk to the analysis.

The plot inset describes the difference between the two ranges: the CDSA range is a measure of the entire path length travelled, the projected range is the one-dimensional maximum range.}

One feature that merits further discussion from Figure~$\ref{fig:all_plots_AB}$ and Figure~$\ref{fig:all_plots_CD}$ is the strong anti-correlation in S1 Pulse Area vs. S2 Pulse Area apparent in cathode events. The cathode region was subject to very high, non-uniform fields due to the thin wires that comprised the cathode grid. Events that occurred on the wires encountered different fields depending on their position on the surface of the wire. Additionally, two events that occurred at exactly the same spot encountered different fields depending on which direction the decay particle (alpha, beta, etc.) traveled. The amount of scintillation and ionization from an interaction in liquid xenon depends on the field at the interaction site. Higher fields result in more ionization electrons being separated from the interaction site and therefore more S2. Mono-energetic events occurring in a uniform field have small anti-correlated fluctuations in S1 and S2 size. Non-uniform fields greatly exaggerate the typical variation in S1 and S2 size resulting in the spread out cathode region (blue) observed in Figures~$\ref{fig:all_plots_AB}$ and $\ref{fig:all_plots_CD}$  (right). Events in the bulk region encounter a relatively low, uniform field resulting in a compact signal region in S1 vs. S2 (visible in red region of calibration data, Dataset D). 

%Some interesting differences between dataset A and B stems from the plate out conditions. Dataset A has a clear beta tail coming off the cathode -- these are Bi-Po events occurring on the cathode, where the beta has penetrated the bulk region, thereby artificially decreasing the time between the alpha S1 and subsequent S2. The more prevalent beta tail can be attributed to the cathode preferentially collecting daughters in the plate-out stage in dataset A due to a supplied voltage. It is interesting to note that for dataset B there are many events events still originate from the cathode, which may indicate a migration of daughters from initial positions on the PTFE walls towards the cathode.

\section{Results}
\label{results}
We observed 11 bulk $^{212}$Bi alphas for dataset A, 20 for dataset B, and 1 background event in the signal region from dataset C. The counts of cathode region $^{212}$Bi alphas are presented in Table $\ref{T:3}$. There was only one background event observed in the signal region, so with 95\% confidence the true background count is at most 4.74. The observed counts for dataset A and B lie far above the 95\% confidence limit for background, indicating they are true observations of  $^{212}$Bi alphas in bulk. Defining the dissolved fraction as $N_{bulk}$ / $N_{cath}$, the dissolved fraction of $^{212}$Bi alphas for dataset A ($\approx$ 13~h livetime) is 0.035 $\pm$ 0.010, and for data set B ($\approx$ 25~h livetime) is 0.099 $\pm$ 0.020. 

These results indicate that either $^{212}$Pb or $^{212}$Bi itself is soluble (i.e. mobile once plated out) to a small degree in liquid xenon. 

%Furthermore, the dissolved fraction per livetime for data set A being less than that of data set B may indicate that daughters adsorbed on Teflon are more likely to dissolve than daughters adsorbed on stainless steel. The rate of $^{220}$Rn entering the detector during the plate-out step was the same for both datasets A and B, but for data set A charged daughters were attracted preferentially to the cathode.
%The 95\% confidence intervals for dataset A (observed 11 counts) are [4.50, 17.50] and dataset B (observed 20 counts) are [11.23,28.76] 

%Findings are consistent with LUX: migration of daughters to cathode and also no large solubility of plated-out daughters into bulk region (LUX bulk >> test bed bulk).  (I don't think this is published yet? Kelsey is currently working on finding radon daughter dissolved events in the bulk.) However, in a field where the signal would be on the order of a few events, a few events of soluble radon should be included in background models.

The solubility calculation is subject to errors from the following factors. Where appropriate, it is noted how the error taken into account in the calculation; otherwise, the assumption is stated.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Liquid height (folded into fiducial volume)
\item Area over which charge amps are sensitive (calculation using different fiducial volumes)
\item Area over which daughters are plated out (varying area over which $^{212}$Bi is distributed; a 10\% error is assumed in the area calculation due to \ac{PTFE} contraction with temperature)
\item Initial activity of plated out daughters (assume circulation time for gas to leave inner PTFE stack > decay time of $^{216}$Po)
\item Livetime calculation (uncertainty included)
\end{enumerate}

Folding in all of these assumptions and errors, we find a best and worst case for datasets A and B. The solubility found in dataset A is at worst 84 $\pm$ 26 Bq/kg/(Bq/cm$^{2}$) and at best 0.091 $\pm$ 0.030 Bq/kg/(Bq/cm$^{2}$). For dataset B, the worst case is 58 $\pm$ 18 Bq/kg/(Bq/cm$^{2}$) and the best case is 0.064 $\pm$ 0.021 Bq/kg/(Bq/cm$^{2}$). The largest factor in the best versus worst case is what volume to identify as the fiducial volume. The worst case assumes the central anode segment only selects events directly beneath it, this leads to the highest solubility. The best case assumes the central anode segment may pick up events anywhere in the active region so the fiducial volume is much larger; this leads to the lowest solubility.

\section{Discussion}
These results are first evidence that the $^{220}$Rn daughters $^{212}$Pb and/or $^{212}$Bi are soluble in liquid xenon (i.e. mobile once plated-out). The dissolved events are a small fraction of events that are plated-out on detector surfaces. These daughters are proxies for the isotopes $^{210}$Pb and/or $^{210}$Bi, which undergo naked beta decays in the $^{222}$Rn chain and pose a problem for liquid xenon dark matter detectors. Our study counts dissolved $^{212}$Bi alpha events as well as $^{212}$Bi alphas plated out on the cathode. We found 11 counts in dataset A and 20 counts in dataset B consistent with $^{212}$Bi decay in the bulk region; these counts are significantly above a background count of 1. The experimental apparatus is not characterized extensively. Regardless, we carried through the solubility calculation, taking into account uncertainties to arrive at a `best case' and `worst case' result. After carrying out the calculations, the range of solubility observed by our method is 0.1 to 84~Bq/kg/(Bq/cm$^{2})$

The limit derived from \ac{LUX} observations, stated in the \ac{LZ} projected sensitivity paper \cite{LZ:Sensitivity}, is 0.1~$\mu$Bq/kg/(Bq/cm$^{2}$) for $^{212}$Bi mobility, given 50~nBq/cm$^{2}$ on \ac{PTFE} panels. Our observed solubility is much greater than this. One explanation (the ``chemistry explanation'')  is that we are sensitive to the `stuck' radon daughters that wash off easily in the first few days of an experiment due to the introduction of \ac{LXe}. Our experiment only tests the initial introduction of \ac{LXe}. Large \ac{TPC}s may then expect an increased rate of radon daughter decays in the fiducial volume at the beginning of a search, but a decreasing rate as these are removed by the getter or are implanted in detector materials. 

Another, testable, explanation that would reconcile the different solubilities in the $^{220}$Rn and $^{222}$Rn chain is beta ejection (the ``particle physics explanation''). Referring to Figure~\ref{fig:Rn220} and Figure~\ref{fig:Rn222}, both bottleneck decays, $^{XXX}$Pb, are beta decays. However, $^{212}$Pb in the $^{220}$Rn chain has a beta decay endpoint of 570~keV, which about 10 times the endpoint energy for $^{210}$Pb in the $^{222}$Rn chain. Daughter recoils from beta decay are indeed small; the endpoints are approximately 0.6~eV for the recoil from $^{212}$Pb decay in the $^{220}$Rn chain and  0.006~eV for the recoil from $^{210}$Pb decay in the $^{222}$Rn chain. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:plateout}, the physisorption potential for both cases is expected to be below 1~eV. Depending on the exact value, which is unavailable, the $^{212}$Pb decay could provide enough energy to liberate the daughter $^{212}$Bi most of the time, whereas $^{210}$Pb decay produces a maximum recoil value below the potential depth. 

Although typically the chemistry-style solubility units (Bq/kg/((Bq/cm$^{2}$)) are utilized, it should be noted that these units imply that larger experiments do not gain an advantage from the volume/surface area ratio. That is, for a given solubility, the rate in the fiducial volume (Bq/kg) is constant as the detector size is scaled up. The term ``solubility'' implies a chemical equilibrium between dissolved bulk Bi and surface Bi, but it is reasonable that a Bi atom, once ejected into the bulk, will likely not come into contact with a surface again. If this is the case, it may be useful to employ probability-style mobility units: the ratio of activity in the bulk to activity on the surface. Unfortunately, our test bed is not sensitive to its walls; that is, we cannot accurately hope to measure the $^{212}$Bi activity on the walls of the detector like \ac{LUX} can. However, utilizing the fact that $\approx$ 90\% of radon daughters are charged \cite{EXOradon}, we can use dataset A to make an estimate of mobility in probability-style units. Since the cathode voltage was at -1~kV during the plate-out procedure, we can make the assumption the 90\% of the radon daughters were collected on the cathode. Using the number of counts observed on the cathode and the livetime from dataset A, we arrive at a plated-out activity of $^{212}$Bi alpha decays of approximately 8~mBq (if the 300 events are distributed over the cathode) or approximately 500~mBq (if we assume the 300 events are from directly beneath the central anode segment and events are distributed similar across all wires). For dataset B, where the cathode voltage was off during plate out, the number of observed cathode events does not relate easily to the total plated-out rate because daughters can collect on any surface. Continuing with dataset A, we can arrive at an observed bulk rate for $^{212}$Bi alpha decays of approximately 250~$\mu$Bq, which gives a mobility probability range of approximately 0.03 - 5$\times$10$^{-4}$. The \ac{LUX} preliminary result\footnote{The measurements were obtained from K. Oliver-Mallory's presentation at IDM 2018 titled ``Latest Analyses and Results from the LUX Experiment.'' The activity of $^{210}$Pb on the wall in the fiducial volume drift range for WS-2014/16 is $>$ 9.6~$\pm$~0.6~mBq. The activity of $^{210}$Pb in the fiducial volume is $<$0.099~$\mu$Bq/kg.} gives a mobility probability of $\approx$0.0026. In probability-style units, the laboratory measurement ($^{220}$Rn chain) is a factor of 10 greater than the \ac{LUX} preliminary result ($^{222}$Rn chain). To explain the discrepancy, the same ``chemistry explanation'' and ''particle physics explanation'' cited above apply.

Further study, where a known amount of $^{220}$Rn daughters are plated out on a known area is necessary to measure dissolution rates. Additional studies that compare the solubility of radon daughters adsorbed on different materials, and under different conditions (e.g. temperature) would also be useful. The effect of cleaning these surfaces before searching for dissolved daughters should also be investigated. 

If beta recoil, not `washing' by the \ac{LXe}, is the cause of radon daughter solubility, then the high rate seen by this study of $^{220}$Rn can be reconciled with the low rate of $^{222}$Rn daughter dissolution seen in \ac{LUX}.
