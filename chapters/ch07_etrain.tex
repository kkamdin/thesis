\section{Motivation for Studying Delayed Single Electron Signals}
Delayed single electron signals, known colloquially as ``electron trains'', are a generic single electron background in dual-phase \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s. Proportional scintillation signals consistent with those of single electrons, being emitted regularly, are known to follow high energy depositions. These electron trains can last $O(10-100)$~ms, which is the equivalent of several event windows for most \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s. Single electron signals were observed and investigated by ZEPLIN \cite{Edwards2008} \cite{Santos2011}, Xenon100 \cite{Aprile2014}, and LUX \cite{Xu2016}. 

\ac{LUX} collaborator Jingke Xu investigated delayed electron signals in \ac{LUX} \cite{Xu2016}. A plot of an electron train from \ac{LUX} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lux_etrain}. Note that the time window is orders of magnitude greater than the \ac{LUX} event window of 400~$\mu$s, and the maximum drift time for Run03 of 300~$\mu$s. In addition to electron trains, the \ac{LUX} collaboration colloquially refers to one type of delayed electron signal as ``electron burps'' or ``e-burps''. They are characterized by the sudden emission of $O(100-1000)$ electrons. Xu noted that e-burps can be part of an electron train, but unlike electron trains in general, he found e-burps to be uncorrelated with the size of the previous event (see inset of Figure~\ref{fig:lux_etrain}).

In Section~\ref{sec:non_wimp_searches_with_lxetpcs}, we discussed several dark matter searches that differ from the standard \ac{WIMP} search and how they can be completed with dual-phase \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s. In particular, recall the Xenon10 search for low-mass \ac{WIMP}s \cite{Angle2011}. The S2-sensitive trigger threshold was set to the level of a single electron, but an analysis threshold of 4 electrons was required for S2 size. The reason behind this is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:xenon10_s2s}. Although single electrons following a high-energy event can be positively identified as belonging to an electron train, electron trains can last $O(10-100)$~ms. In any event window following the start of electron train, it is unknown whether the single electron is truly a small energy deposition from a low-mass dark matter event or if it belongs to an electron train. Moreover, single electrons from a train can pile up in time, creating energy depositions the size of 2 and more electrons -- so an analysis threshold of 2 electrons is not sufficient to cut out electron train backgrounds. In general, electron trains are irritating for \ac{WIMP} searches because some percentage of the detector livetime is taken up by electron train pile-up; but they greatly limit the discovery potential for low-mass searches, as the expected signal size (S2 of 2 or 3 electrons) is possibly electron train pile-up, and therefore must be considered as such.

Xenon100 measured the rates of 1-,2-, and 3-electron signals following an S2 \cite{Aprile2014}. They saw a relation of the time constants $\tau_{3} \approx \tau_{1}/3$ for 3-electron signals compared to 1-electron signals, and $\tau_{2} \approx \tau_{1}/2$ for 2-electron signals. They note that if multi-electron signal results from accidental time coincidences of single electrons, these time relations can be explained. 


\section{Origin of Delayed Single-Electron Signals}
While the origin of delayed single electron signals is still an area of active research, some behavior of electron trains are fairly well understood. An electron train can be split into two time regions: the primary event window ($O(100)$~$\mu$s, e.g. 400~$\mu$s in \ac{LUX}), and the following train, which continues for $O(10-100)$~ms. A few features are typically evident in the primary event window, which have origin in physical phenomena. These phenomena and what is found in the literature are discussed in the following subsections. 

\subsection{Photoionization on Grids} 
The large number of \ac{VUV} photons in big S2s are capable of liberating electrons from metallic electrodes. Electrons can be photoionized on any grid in the \ac{TPC}, but the effect is largest on the grids closest to the gas gap where the S2 is generated. Photoionized electrons from the anode aren't detected because they have essentially no space in which to proportionally scintillate. Photoionized electrons from extraction grid are directed toward the gas gap, extracted and then undergo proportional scintillation. These electrons join the S2 signal at a delay approximately equal to the distance between the extraction grid and the liquid-gas interface. Large S2s have tails that are composed of electrons photoionized from the extraction grid. An average of many high-energy S2s, clearly shows the photoionization feature (Figure~\ref{fig:s2_averages}).

\caption{The average of many high energy S2s from \ac{LUX}, plotted with logarithmic y-scale, showing a prominent photoionization feature. After the photoionization, an instrumental effect is visible: for the highest-energy events, one to a few \ac{PMT}s often do not return to baseline quickly, which gives the single electrons in the following train artificially higher areas.

\subsection{Photoionization of Impurities} 
Electronegative impurities in the liquid (e.g. O$_{2}$, N$_{2}$) capture ionization electrons from events as they are drifted to the gas region (e.g. O$_{2}$ binds an electron at 0.45~eV to become O$^{-}_{2}$). Just as the \ac{VUV} photons can ionize electrons from grids, they can also ionize electrons attached to impurities. Xenon100 found that the rate of single electrons in the primary event window scaled with S2 size, as well as the concentration of impurities \cite{Aprile2014} (see Figure~\ref{fig:electron_rates}). Some of the electrons in the primary event window of an electron train are now believed to come from photoionized impurities. This is supported by Xenon100 data which showed that the rate of single electrons has a sharp cut off corresponding to the maximum drift time, and the the PMT hit pattern of the multi-electron signals are not localized around one PMT but rather spread over the PMT array \cite{Aprile2014}.

\subsection{Delayed Extraction of Trapped Electrons} 
Dual-phase \ac{LXe} \ac{TPC}s depend on the ability to extract electrons from liquid into gas. This is accomplished with some efficiency, called the \ac{EEE}. Gushchin et al. measured the absolute \ac{EEE} in xenon and argon in 1982 as function of electric field  \cite{Gushchin1982} (see Figure~\ref{fig:eee}. Their result extends to an extraction field of 5~kV/cm in the liquid. It is common practice for modern experiments that achieve an extraction field $\gtrsim$~5keV/cm to assume they have 100\% extraction, an assumption based on the Gushchin result. Relative extraction efficiency is measured only by the size of the S2 scintillation light and inferred number of initial ionization electrons based on calibration source energy and knowledge of recombination. Relative measurements of \ac{EEE} as a function of extraction field assume 100\% extraction at the highest field and scale the other points accordingly. In contrast, absolute extraction efficiency measurements measure the number of electrons generated in the liquid as well as how many are extracted with no scaling. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

(right) Two relative \ac{EEE} measurements from modern experiments, Xenon100 and PIXEY, compared to Gushchin. The plot is from the PIXEY result \cite{Edwards2018}, where the authors fit their result with a quadratic function ($y=ax^{2} + bx + c$). The fit to the PIXEY data (black dashed line) is scaled by a constant and applied to the Xenon100 data (blue dotted line). }
\label{fig:eee}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Since there does not exist a second absolute measurement of \ac{EEE} out to higher extraction fields, it is uncertain when 100\% \ac{EEE} is reached in \ac{LXe}. However, it is well known that the number of extracted electrons depends on the extraction field. In addition to photoionization of impurities, it is thought that the unextracted electrons are liberated from the liquid surface at a later time, making up some component of electron trains \cite{Aprile2014}, \cite{Edwards2018}. To understand why we must consider the energy of the electrons in the liquid, and the potential barrier they encounter in order to escape into gas.

When an electron approaches a dielectric boundary held at a constant potential, a potential barrier results from its image charge. This barrier, called the Shottky barrier, takes the form:

\begin{equation}
\phi_{b} = \frac{e^{2}}{8\pi \epsilon_{0} z} \frac{\epsilon - 1}{\epsilon + 1}
\end{equation}

where $z$ is often taken to be the lattice spacing of the medium, $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant of the medium, and $\epsilon_{0}$ is the usual vacuum permittivity. If \ac{LXe} is arranged in a simple cubic lattice, $z \approx$ 4~\AA, and the calculation yields $\phi_{b} = 0.61$~eV \cite{Sorensen2017}. The potential barrier of liquid xenon was measured by Tauchert to be 0.67~eV \cite{Tauchert1975}. There are two modes for emission of electrons across a surface boundary: (1) ``hot'' electrons accelerated by an electric field gain enough energy to overcome the barrier and be extracted (2) emission of thermal electrons, where only electrons in the tail of the velocity distribution have enough energy to escape the boundary. For an external field $E$, the Schottky barrier is lowered by

\begin{equation}
\Delta \phi_{b} = e \Big ( \frac{eE}{4\pi \epsilon_{0} z} \frac{\epsilon - 1}{\epsilon + 1} \Big ) ^{1/2}
\end{equation}

The $E$ field also results in the aforementioned heating of the electrons. The new energy distribution can be determined by solving the Boltzmann equation as in \cite{Cohen1967}. With the energy distribution and adjusted barrier height, the \ac{EEE} as a function of electric field can be calculated. It is the fraction of electrons with energy expectation value above $\phi_{b} - \Delta\phi_{b}$:

\begin{equation}
 \kappa = \int_{\phi_{b} - \Delta\phi_{b}}^\infty K^{1/2} f(K) dK \Big / \int_{0}^{\infty} K^{1/2} f(K)dK
 \end{equation}

$K = K(E)$ is the electron energy, which is implicitly a function of the electric field and $f(K)$ is the energy distribution of the electrons under the influence of an electric field. The factor within the integral is $K^{1/2}$ instead of the usual $K$ in order to select only electrons that have an upward velocity component. The red \ac{LXe} line in Gushchin's \ac{EEE} result (Figure~\ref{fig:eee} (left)) is from this calculation with the assumption that $\phi_{b}=0.61$~eV. Bolozdynya follows a similar approach and notes that electrons which are not emitted as hot electrons are thermalized by collisions and can be emitted later as thermal electrons \cite{Bolozdynya1999}. Others have treated the potential barrier as a free parameter and fit to data. Gushchin, seeing that the line did not fit the data for \ac{LXe}, treated the value of $\phi_{b}$ as free in the integral above. He found $\phi_{b}= 0.85$~eV was a better fit \cite{Gushchin1982}, but the agreement is still not very satisfying. Sorensen implemented an $n$-th chance model for electrons approaching the liquid-gas boundary, and found that with $\phi_{b}= 0.34$~eV and $n=20$, his model fits Gushchin's data \cite{Sorensen2017}. If the $n$-th chance model is applied, with some assumptions about the relaxation time for electrons to be thermalized, the time constant for emission of thermal electrons is $O(10)$~ms. Both Bolozdyna and Sorensen note that the relaxation time is dependent on field (strength and direction), temperature. Sorensen adds possible diffusion effects, fluid flow, varying surface height, etc. Although research is still on-going into how to how properly model the physics of electron extraction, there is agreement that a fast component from extracted hot electrons yields the initial S2 and a thermal component from the unextracted electrons contributes in part to the electron train.


\section{Test Bed Studies Of Electron Trains}
An initial goal of the test bed described in Chapter~\ref{ch:testbed} was to complete an absolute measurement of \ac{EEE}. Unlike typical \ac{TPC}s, the testbed can be ``overfilled'', with the liquid level above the anode, and the generation of ionization electrons in the liquid can be measured with the charge amplifiers. The liquid level can then be dropped between the anode and extraction grid for a measure of extracted electrons with S2 (and with the charge amplifiers). During the multi-year process of instrumenting and understanding the test bed, this goal changed and evolved. The remainder of this chapter briefly describes the attempts made with the radon source and configuration as in Chapter~\ref{ch:radon}, then summarizes the most recent results published in \cite{SorensenKamdin2018}, which used a $^{210}$Po source.

\subsection{Radon Source and TPC Configuration}
The $^{220}$Rn flow through source described in the previous chapter (Chapter~\ref{ch:radon}) was initially chosen for electron train studies because:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{High Energy} The alpha events in the $^{220}$Rn fast chain have energies of 6.4~MeV ($^{220}$Rn)  and 6.9~MeV ($^{216}$Po). $W_{LXe} = 13.7$~quanta/eV, so these alphas generate $O(500,000)$~quanta. Although ~90\% of alpha energy goes into S1 \cite{Aprile2010}, that still leaves $O(50,000)$~electrons to be detected. In contrast, a 662~keV $^{137}$Cs button source produces $O(50,000)$~quanta, but this value is $\sim$halved by recombination. Alpha light and charge yields are also do not vary greatly with applied field, see Figure~\ref{fig:recombination} (right)
\item \textbf{Uniformly Distributed with Compact Track} The $^{220}$Rn can be deposited directly into the \ac{LXe}, yielding a uniformly distributed source which can be fiducialized to the inner-most anode segment to avoid field edge effects. Alphas do not travel far, and so a deposition could be realistically expected to deposit all its energy in the $(x,y)$ resolution of the detector, i.e. under one and only one anode segment (recall the 2.2~MeV beta that could travel 1.2~mm from Chapter~\ref{ch:radon})
\end{itemize}

 problems: expected to be able to select mono-energetic signal w/ PMT spectrum. 
 
 probelms: PMT saturation, low signal efficiency/low trigger rate w/ bullseye -- most events happening elsewhere. had to collect data for long time, charges built up on grids, betas complicated charge spectrum further. also had big loss of charge across extraction grid, which made signals small.
